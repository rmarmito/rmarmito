### Hello, (GitHub) World 👋 I'm Richard!

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at San Diego State University. I have a passion for problem solving, programming, designing, video games, and most importantly: interacting with people!

I am a sponge -- the world of technology surprises me everyday, so I absorb and apply as much information, techniques, and practices I can! 

- I am currently building a full-stack project: GamerMingle
- I am currently learning: JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJS

I am very welcoming to feedback or advice. Please feel free to reach out for either, or just to chat!

🤝 Connect with me on LinkedIn

Happy Coding!
